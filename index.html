A lot of ships and aircrafts that were disspeard in the circumstances that are not solved yet.&nbsp;<br></p><p style="line-height: 1.5;">Is it just me or every person at some point in their life has heard about it and maybe been crazy about it for a while trying to research and find a solution?</p><p style="line-height: 1.5;">Places like this that are misterious and scary but in the same time drive people nuts and make them want to visit them.</p><p style="line-height: 1.5;">Yes Theory will take people from Yes Fam in this adventure. When we decide the road than we can decide the people we will take. If the transportation will be by airplane than we will invite people who are afraid of flights and if the transportation will be through water we will invite people who are afraid of open waters.&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height: 1.5;">How can a person seek discomfort more than fighting their fears in a place like this?!</p><p style="line-height: 1.5;"><br></p><p style="line-height: 1.5;"><br></p>

Wait until you hear this ...</p><p>While searching for Tuvalu after watching your video my friend told me about this island that is totally isolated from the outside world.</p><p>Have you ever heard about North Sentinel Island? It is known as frobidden island in Indian Ocean. You may ask what makes this island different from many many islands in that Ocean. It is its population. A tribe that isolated itself from outside world more than a thousand years ago and where outsiders are not welcome.&nbsp;</p><p>A trip to this island is very risky and also frobbiden so what we can do is visit its neighbor islands and try to find as many information for it as possible.</p><p>The fact of letting people know that this exist is exciting enough so I guess even if its not possible to visit any place near it just making a video about it and talking to people who has studied for this island will be amazing.</p><p>This can happen during COVID as well we just need to find those people and intreview them.</p>

But not impossible!&nbsp; </p><p>Elon Musk plans to send a SpaceX rocket to Mars, with cargo only, by 2022, according to the SpaceX website. A second mission, which would take more cargo and crew, is targeted for 2024. Musk has also said he'll send a million people to Mars by 2050.</p><p>Our real intention is to try and contact Elon Musk and have a meeting with him. Just like u did with the Mayor of Montreal but instead of creating a handshake you have to convinse him to let you sign to go to Mars with him in his future journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is crazy about Elon and its amazing inventions.</p><p>If you think contacting Elon Musk is impossible than check this website.

                        <p>Feet on Earth now... </p><p>

Lets see with what problems are we dealing here and what can we do for them. We all want to take diets and we need motivation for them. </p><p>According to Tren Hamm, the founder of Simple Dollar a person spends $7.64 per day on food. In the same time there are 805 million people who go undernourished on a daily basis, consuming less than the recommended 2,100 calories a day. </p><p>

Okay I am not saying we should feed 805 million people but start small to make a big impact right. </p><p>

The idea is to create a new challenge. FAST to FEED!</p><p>

Fasting is a practice that has been associated with a wide array of potential health benefits, including weight loss, as well as improved blood sugar control, heart health, brain function and cancer prevention. </p><p>You have tried fasting during Ramadan and Ammar as a muslim does it for a whole month once a year.
</p><p>
What if we tell people to fast and get the benefits of fasting and also donate the money they had to spend on that day to people in need for food.</p><p>

We can either create an account on gofundme.com than give the money to a families in need through any organization or tell people to give them themselves to families that they know and that are in need. </p><p>

I am sure that every person is ready to do soemthing like this that will help their health and also make an impact on the world!
</p><p>
It will be something similiar to 100 days of sweat!</p><p>This can also come during this COVID situation where everyone is trying not to eat as much food and stay healthy!<br></p><p></p><p><br></p>
